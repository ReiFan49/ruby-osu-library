# osu-ruby-v2

This is an improvement of my 7+ years old of osu!-related program.
This library will allow you to perform many things way more than former one.

Fair enough, I don't know what to put. This library still not in ready-phase except the database one...
I'm working on this slowly.

## About the Code Rule

This is still under adjustment. I'll see what actually fits with my style.
(Fair enough, it's rather hard for me to comprehend from the time I know it)

## Disclaimer

- osu! is a game created under ppy Pty Ltd. I do not claim osu! as my own.
- This is fair scratch creation from zero, as opposed the wonky osu ruby v1 I had.
- For any damage caused by this program, I do not responsible for it, please understand.

## How to use

### Database

```ruby
# This should be enough to require for what Database feature needs
# All namespace under database and the IO processing for it.
require 'osu-ruby2/database'
```
